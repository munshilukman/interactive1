<div><h1><font face="wingdings">But apps like Instagram are blind - or almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths. The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</font></h1>

<h2><font face="wingdings">Even before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed. Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.</font></h2>

<h3><font face="wingdings">The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that's picked for them by complex â€“and secretive - algorithms.</font></h3>

<h4><font face="wingdings">The Stream means you don't need to open so many websites any more. You don't need numerous tabs. You don't even need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you. According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste time in finding interesting things on so many websites.</font></h4>

<h5><font face="wingdings">But are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency?</font></h5>

<h6><font face="wingdings">In many apps, the votes we cast - the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts - are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance of what's posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.</font></h6></div>
